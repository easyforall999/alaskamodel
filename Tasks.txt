no-sql database - document db
As this data is live stream, kafka steams can be used to store such information
Using Psub model (publisher subscriber) is also another alternative

pros and cons:

- High performance: this db is highly performant than SQL db as the data is stored
    in one database
- Scalability: this DB is horizontally Scalabile
- Flexibility: Flexibility in trying different datamodels in real time

Cons:
- Maturity: this db is not as mature as relational DBs, leading to less information
    and support compared to relational DBs
- Requires multiple databases: as this is not a complete solution for all needs
    , team would be Required to maintain multiple databases
- Huge databases: as data is stored in a single database, the size of database
    is generally Huge
